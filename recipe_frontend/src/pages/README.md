This folder contains screen-level React components and their scoped styles:
- LoginPage.jsx + login.css (Sign In screen)
- HomePage.jsx + home.css (Home screen)

Styles are scoped using a top-level container class (.login-screen, .home-screen) to avoid global conflicts while preserving pixel measurements from the Figma-derived static assets.
